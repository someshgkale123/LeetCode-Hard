Problem Statement:

Given n non-negative integers representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, find the area of largest rectangle in the histogram.
Above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1, given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3].
The largest rectangle is shown in the shaded area, which has area = 10 unit.
Example:
Input: [2,1,5,6,2,3]
Output: 10



Solution:
class Solution:
    def largestRectangleArea(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        ###### O(N);O(N)
        mxarea=0        
        stack=[]
        heights=[0]+heights+[0]
        for i in range(len(heights)):
            while stack and heights[stack[-1]]>heights[i]:
                top=stack.pop()
                print(top,heights[top]*(i-stack[-1]-1))
                area=heights[top]*(i-stack[-1]-1)
                mxarea=max(area,mxarea)
            stack.append(i)
        return mxarea
